# Proof of Concept

## Proof of Concept (POC) Name:
Adding types of exercises to the list of exercises that the user can pick when logging in his exercises.

## Functionality in this POC:
A logged in user will log in the list of exercise and select a specific exercise (e.g. Type of Exercise: Cardio, Weighlifting, Stretching, Powerlifting, etc.). Then user will modify specific exercise by adding workout plan (e.g. Cardio: Cycling for 10 minutes, Streching: Arm Circle for 10 times, and Powerlifting: Bench Press for 10 reps in 3 sets).

## Data store:
All database tables required for the above functionality are already in place. Firebase will update existing list of exercise with no  additional tables will created. Although, there would be additional tables will be created in types of exercise.

## Assumptions/Exclusions
The functionality to add or modify existing exercise or work plan list that is not part of this POC.
